## How do I submit a Contribution?

We follow a [very standard Github workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so if you have a basic idea of how open-source contributions work, you can contribute!

Simply open an issue if you'd like to add a feature, or check out our currently open issues.

## What do I get out of contributing?

Contributing to open source carries a ton of benefits:

- Learning and practicing new skills. (in our case, you'd gain experience with React, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Web Development)
- Networking. You'll virtually work with other developers, gaining real world experience. This is a huge benefit.
- Resume and Interview material. If you're a new developer, open-source is a great way to gain experience. This is another huge benefit. Use open source to build your career and improve your reputation in the industry!

We appreciate everyone who contributes to Revista, whether it's a small or large contribution. Contributing to open source is like tech volunteer work. It's rewarding to contribute your time to advance technology, share code and knowledge, and build an open community online.
