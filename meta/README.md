# Purpose of the `meta` folder

This folder contains meta information and reference material about Revista. For example, a manually written categories list that can easily be referred to. 

Our goal for this folder was to organize and present a clear, high-level overview of the content we currently have (or want to add in the future.)

You are welcome to use it to organize thoughts. Or, deleting the `/meta` folder will not cause any errors.
